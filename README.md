# COSC-381-Final-Backup
This is a backup of one of my projects from my software engineering class.
This project grabs and displays a list of movies from a database. 
This project uses the IBM translator API to translate the movie title and overview from english to chinese.
This project also uses the YouTube API to grab the correct trailer for each movie.
